      <p>
        The Heart of Virginia Intergroup (often referred to simply as
        <em>Intergroup</em>) is an umbrella service organization, under the
        direction of representatives of district home groups to provide services
        and sponsor activities for home groups, AA members and individuals in
        recovery or seeking recovery from alcoholism
      </p>

      <p>
        As a vehicle for coordination and cooperation among home groups,
        Intergroup helps to achieve efficiency and economy for its home groups
        and to make AA’s hand more readily available to help the suffering
        alcoholic. It works in close partnership with a sister organization, the
        Heart of Virginia Service Committee (often referred to as <em
          >District</em
        >). Listed below are some of the services provided by Intergroup.
      </p>

        <h2>Heart of Virginia Intergroup Services</h2>

        <h3>Maintain aaheartofva.org</h3>
        <p>
          Intergroup maintains this website to provide information over the
          internet about open and closed meeting (days, times and locations)
          special events, volunteer opportunities, and other information about
          JDI, JDSC, and various AA support activities and functions. To post
          meeting updates and notices on the web site, send the information to <a
            href="mailto:AACharlottesville@gmail.com"
            >AACharlottesville@gmail.com</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Run the Central Office</h4>
        <p>
          With assistance from JDSC, Intergroup rents an office (Suite 3-A, 1807
          Emmet Street) for a variety of uses including telecommunications
          linkage, access to purchase literature and chips, answering calls,
          maintaining files and records, storing and making available supplies
          for events. The office is used as a meeting room for committees, open
          and closed meetings, sponsor/sponsee sessions, and other special
          meetings.
        </p>

        <h3>Answer Calls</h4>
        <p>
          In order to respond to telephone inquiries from persons seeking
          information about local AA meetings and activities, Intergroup
          maintains a list of AA volunteers to answer incoming calls. An
          answering service routes these calls to AA volunteers when no one is
          available to answer the phone at the Intergroup office. AA volunteers
          are always needed for this important service of responding to calls.
          For more information, see the “Service” tab at the web site.
        </p>

        <h3>Publish Up-to-Date Meeting Information</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to web site information, every second month Intergroup
          prints a list of home group meetings (days, times and locations) for
          distribution at meetings. To submit updates to meeting schedules send
          the information to AACharlottesville@gmail.com.
        </p>

        <h3>Coordinate Special Events</h4>
        <p>
          The Intergroup, on its own or in cooperation with JDSC or home groups,
          sponsors the Christmas and other marathons, the Founder’s Day picnic,
          conferences, special events and fellowship activities.
        </p>

        <h3>Supply Literature and Chips to Home Groups</h4>
        <p>
          Intergroup maintains at the central office an inventory of AA books
          and pamphlets for home groups and members to purchase. Also, available
          is a supply of plastic chips and bronze medallions to mark
          individual’s time in sobriety. This Intergroup service makes it
          easier, quicker and less costly for home groups and individuals to
          obtain AA-authorized books. See the “Literature and Chips” tab at the
          web site.
        </p>

        <h3>Serve as a Forum for Communication Among Home Groups</h4>
        <p>
          Both Intergroup and JDSC are forums for communication and coordination
          among home groups. Where there are activities, projects, issues and
          questions that cut across many home groups, JDI serves as an important
          focal point for exchange of information and collaboration. Such
          communication and coordination helps to achieve efficiency and economy
          for the home groups and to assure AA’s availability to help the
          suffering alcoholic and those in recovery.
        </p>

        <h3>Coordinate Issues of Intergroup Interest and Concern</h4>
        <p>
          Every home group is entitled and encouraged to send a representative
          to the monthly JDI meetings, held at 7:00 PM on the first Thursday of
          the month at Westminster Presbyterian Church, 450 Rugby Road.
          Individual members are always welcomed guests! Pursuant to the
          governance bylaws, decisions are made after discussion and voting by
          groups’ representatives.
        </p>

        <h3>Financially Support Intergroup Operations and Services</h4>
        <p>
          The services provided by Intergroup are made possible by contributions
          from home groups and AA members. Without those contributions,
          Intergroup cannot provide the services listed above. Home groups are
          encouraged to make quarterly contributions to JDI to support ongoing
          operations and services. Contributions from AA members are always
          helpful too. Donations can be made payable to Jefferson District
          Intergroup and mailed to P.O. Box 6911, Charlottesville, VA 22906.
