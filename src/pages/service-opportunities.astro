      In addition to what is listed below, keep in mind that your presence at
      meetings is a form of service to other alcoholics. While you're there, you
      can serve in a number of ways, like making coffee, helping with set up and
      clean up, greeting, and of course sharing your experience, strength, and
      hope.
